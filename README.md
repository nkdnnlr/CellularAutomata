# ComputationalModels
Some tests on counter machines, cellular automata and related systems. Elaboration of visualizing and "tonifying" different models, i.e. mapping the output to pixels or frequencies. 


1. Calculating cellular automata for different rules, initializing with one filled block and all others empty.
